    <h1>React Interview Question and Answer</h1>

    <h3>1 . What is react? what are its features?</h3>
    <div>
      React was created by Jordane Walke , a software engineer at facebook in
      the year 2011 and it was deployed first at the facebook newsfeed and later
      it was used in facebook and instagram. React is a open source front end js
      library . It follows the component based approach for building reusable UI
      components speacially for single page application and it is used for
      developing interactive view layer of web and mobile application.
      <br />
      <ul type="1">
        <li>Virual Dom</li>
        <li>One Way Data Binding</li>
        <li>Reusable Component</li>
        <li>JSX(Javascript Syntex Extention)</li>
        <li>Performance</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <br /><br />

    <h3>2 . Explain virual Dom ?</h3>
    <div>
      DOM stands for document object model and this represent the logical
      structure of document. Dom is a document.DOM is a document object model,
      created by converting HTML CSS and JS Real DOM, which is an object which
      gets created whenever any React application gets loaded on the screen for
      the first time., whenever React components gets mounted on the screen for
      the first time. Now when any user makes any changes on the screen like
      button click because of which the state variable will get updated so in
      this case the changes will not directly go to Real DOM , instead in react
      we have concept known Virtual DOM. So we are having two virtual doms, one
      virtual dom gets created at the time of mounting of react component so it
      is a copy of your real dom. Another virtual dom is the dom which contains
      the new changes, updated state variables values. Now these two virtual
      doms will get compared with each other and will check for the new changes.
      this complete procedure is known as diffing algorithm. Now the new changes
      will be updated in your Real dom. this procedure is known as
      Recoinciliation

    <h3>4 . difference between react, angular, veu</h3>
    <div>
      React is a UI library, Angular is a fully-fledged front-end framework,
      while Vue.js is a progressive framework.
    </div>

    <br /><br />

    <h3>5 . What is Library and Framework?</h3>
    <div>
      liberary is a set of reusable function used by computer programs and
      framework it is a piece of code that dictates the architecture of a
      project,In Liberary code call the liberary but in framework,framework
      calls the code .in liberary we control the data flow by methods but in
      framework we don't have any control of the data flow framework decide how
      the data will flow that is nothing but frameworks calls the code. and in
      performance wise react is having hogher performance over angular and vue
      and community support and also react is having the easy learning curve and
      react is having SPA(single page application)
    </div>

    <h3>6 . Difference between class and functional components?</h3>
    <div>
      In class component we are having Lifecycle methods where as in functional
      component haveing hooks. <br /><br />functional component are also called
      stateless component and class component is called statefull component and
      their is no render function while in fuunctional component their is
      return.<br /><br />
      In functional component accept props as an arrgument but props and state
      can be accepted in class components<br />
      <br />
      functional component are easy to read as they have less code but in class
      components have complex code structure and hard to write.
      <br /><br />
      In class component we use the "this" keyword but in functional we don't
      needthe keyword.
    </div>

    <br /><br />

    <h3>7 .State less and Statefull</h3>
    <div>
      Stateless component doesn't hold or manage state, Statefull component can
      hold or manage state,Stateless - It is simple and easy to understand but
      in statefull component it is complex as compared to the stateless
      components.<br />
      Stateless does not work with any lifecycle but whereas statefull work with
      lifecycle methods . Stateless can not be reused while can be be used in
      case of statefull component. sTateless component is known as Functional
      Component and statefull is a Class Component.
    </div>

    <br /><br />

    <h3>8 . Different Phases of react components lifecycle?</h3>
    <div>
      In ReactJS, every component creation process involves various lifecycle
      methods. These lifecycle methods are termed as component's lifecycle.
      These lifecycle methods are not very complicated and called at various
      points during a component's life.<br /><br />

      The lifecycle of the component is divided into four phases. They are:<br />
      1. Initial Phase <br /><br />

      2. Mounting Phase -The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM.
      This phase covers initialization from constructor(),
      getDerivedStateFromProps(), render(), and componentDidMount() lifecycle
      methods. <br /><br />

      3. Updating Phase - In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways,
      sending the new props and updating the state either from setState() or
      forceUpdate(). This phase covers getDerivedStateFromProps(),
      shouldComponentUpdate(), render(), getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() and
      componentDidUpdate() lifecycle methods. <br /><br />

      4. Unmounting Phase - In this last phase, the component is not needed and
      gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes
      componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method.<br /><br />

      Each phase contains some lifecycle methods that are specific to the
      particular phase
    </div>

    <h3>
      9 . What is Single Page Application or SPA? Explain the difference between
      SPA and MPA?
    </h3>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          in terms of speed and performance SPA no reloading is needed that is
          equal to high speed and responsivenss
        </li>
        <li>
          MPA which is having slow speed and performanceis affected by reloading
        </li>
        <li>according to coding reusable code for SPA</li>
        <li>MPA needs to coding from scratch</li>
        <li>according to maintenance SPA is fast and easy maintenance</li>
        <li>for MPA maintenance required for each page</li>
        <li>accordingto SEO SPA is having limited optimization</li>
        <li>according to user experience SPA is very smooth and friendly</li>
        <li>MPA user experienceis bad</li>
        <li>there is no loading time required for SPA</li>
        <li>SPA secures only endpoints</li>
        <li>MPA secures end to end</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>10 . Difference between states and props?</h3>
    <div>
      1. State changes can be asynchronous ,Props can be readonly<br />
      2. Props can be accessed by child components, state can't be accessed by
      child components<br />
      3. props are used to communication between components, state can be used
      to change within the component<br />
      4. props are immutable,props are external and control by whatever render
      the components.<br />
      5. The state is internal and control by react component itself.<br />state
      is mutable.
    </div>

    <br /><br />

    <h3>11 . Explain props drilling concept and state uplifting?</h3>
    <div>
      <br />
      Props drilling is basically a situation in the same data is been sent to
      sent it almost every due to the requirement in the final level.
      <br />
      when we have to share the same data across multiple child components then
      define the data into the paraent every component in react has its own
      state because of these data can be reabundant and inconsistant so by
      liftingup the stae of the parent component as a single source of the truth
      and pass the data of the children in its parent.
    </div>

    <br /><br />

    <h3>12 . Diffrence between controlled and uncontrolled components?</h3>
    <div>
      In the controlled component data is controlled by the parent components
      whereas in uncontrolled component data is controlled by the DOM itself,
      <br />
      controlled component allow validation control whereas in uncontrolled
      component it doesn't allow validatopn control<br />In controlled component
      it has better control over the forms and data and in uncontrolled
      component limited control over forms and data.
    </div>

    <br /><br />

    <h3>13 . What is react router?</h3>
    <div>
      React router is a standered liberary for rounting in react it enable the
      navigation among the vieews of a various components in react application
      .it allow changing the browser URL.<br />
      React Router plays an important role to display multiple views in a single
      page application
